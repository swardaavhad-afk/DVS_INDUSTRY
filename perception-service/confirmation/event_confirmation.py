"""
Turns raw rule/model event candidates into a confidence tier
(CONFIRMED / PROBABLE / LOW_CONFIDENCE) by requiring persistence across
multiple evaluation windows, per the design doc's event-confirmation
mechanism (design doc section 6). This is what prevents a single noisy
frame from becoming an incident report.

Keyed by (camera_id, event_type, primary_track_id) so that, e.g., two
different people loitering in two different zones are tracked as separate
candidate "streaks" rather than one blended signal.
