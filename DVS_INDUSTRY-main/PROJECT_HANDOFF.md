# DVS Industries Project Handoff

This document explains the DVS Industries project for someone who has not worked on it before.

## 1. What This Project Is

DVS Industries is a manufacturing ERP and operations platform. It is designed to manage:

- Employees, departments, shifts, and attendance
- Materials, stock movement, and scrap
- Suppliers, clients, client orders, and purchase orders
- Production work orders and output
- Security incidents and alerts
- Reports, KPIs, and audit history
- User login, roles, permissions, and refresh sessions

It is a full-stack application:

```text
Browser
  -> React + Vite frontend on port 5173
  -> Express + TypeScript backend on port 3000
  -> PostgreSQL database on port 5433
```

There is no Supabase, Firebase, cloud database, or third-party authentication service in the current implementation.

## 2. Current Local URLs

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173/`
- Frontend alternative: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000/`
- API prefix: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health`
- Metrics: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/metrics`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5433`, database `dvs_factory`

The Vite development server proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to the backend.

## 4. How Login Works

1. The user opens the frontend and selects a portal.
2. The login form sends `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
3. The backend validates the email and password with bcrypt.
4. The backend updates `User.lastLogin`.
5. The backend creates a refresh-token record in `RefreshToken`.
6. The backend returns an access JWT and user profile.
7. The refresh token is placed in a secure HttpOnly cookie.
8. The frontend stores the access token in browser `localStorage` under `dvs_access_token`.
9. The frontend stores the safe user profile under `dvs_user`.
10. The user's backend role is mapped to a frontend dashboard role.
11. Axios attaches the access token to API calls and silently refreshes it after a 401 when possible.

The backend role is an object such as `{ name: "ADMIN" }`. The frontend auth adapter extracts the role name before selecting the dashboard.

### Roles

- `ADMIN`: full access
- `MANAGER`: management and reports
- `HR`: workforce and employee operations
- `STORE`: inventory, suppliers, and supply chain
- `PRODUCTION`: production operations
- `SALES`: client orders and sales operations

The frontend currently maps `MANAGER` and `HR` to the admin-style dashboard, `PRODUCTION` to production, and `STORE`/`SALES` to the store/order area.

## 5. Where Data Is Stored

All durable business data is stored in PostgreSQL through Prisma. The database is `dvs_factory`.

| Business area | Prisma models | What is stored |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | `Role`, `User`, `RefreshToken` | Roles, users, password hashes, last login, refresh sessions |
| Departments | `Department` | Department names, codes, managers, active/deleted state |
| Workforce | `Employee`, `Shift`, `Attendance` | Employee profiles, job data, shifts, clock-in/out, attendance status |
| Inventory | `Material`, `StockTransaction`, `ScrapRecord` | Material catalog, current stock, stock movements, scrap records |
| Orders | `Supplier`, `Client`, `ClientOrder`, `PurchaseOrder` | Business partners, sales orders, procurement orders, statuses, dates, values |
| Production | `WorkOrder`, `WorkOrderOutput` | Work orders, quantities, production output, rejected and scrap quantities |
| Security | `SecurityIncident`, `IncidentUpdate`, `SecurityAlert` | Incidents, comments/status changes, alerts, acknowledgements and resolutions |
| Auditing | `AuditLog` | Successful writes, login/logout, status changes, actor, endpoint, status code |

Passwords are stored only as bcrypt hashes. Plain passwords are never returned by the API.

Access JWTs are not stored in PostgreSQL. They are short-lived browser tokens. Refresh tokens are stored in PostgreSQL and also sent to the browser as an HttpOnly cookie.

Uploaded profile images are stored on disk under `backend/uploads/profiles/`. They are served by Express at `/uploads/...`. They are not stored inside PostgreSQL.

Password-reset tokens are currently kept in backend memory. They expire after 15 minutes but are lost if the backend restarts. A database table or Redis should be added before using password reset in production.

## 6. How New Records Are Created

The normal data flow is:

```text
Frontend form
  -> frontend/src/lib/services/<module>.service.ts
  -> Axios /api/v1 request
  -> route validation with Zod
  -> authentication and authorization middleware
  -> controller
  -> service business rules
  -> repository
  -> Prisma
  -> PostgreSQL
```

For example, creating a purchase order:

1. The Orders page loads real suppliers from PostgreSQL.
2. The user selects a supplier and enters material, quantity, cost, and delivery date.
3. The frontend sends `POST /api/v1/orders/purchase-orders` with the supplier's real database ID.
4. The backend verifies the supplier exists and is active.
5. The repository inserts a `PurchaseOrder` row.
6. The frontend reloads the purchase-order list from the API.
7. Refreshing the browser still shows the saved row because it is in PostgreSQL.

The same pattern is used for client orders, materials, employees, work orders, incidents, and other persisted modules.

## 7. API Modules

| Prefix | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/auth` | Login, register, refresh, logout, profile, password changes |
| `/api/v1/departments` | Department CRUD and soft deletion |
| `/api/v1/employees` | Employee lifecycle and profile image upload |
| `/api/v1/workforce` | Shifts, attendance, clock-in/out, trends |
| `/api/v1/inventory` | Materials, stock transactions, scrap |
| `/api/v1/orders` | Suppliers, clients, client orders, purchase orders |
| `/api/v1/production` | Work orders, output, KPIs, trends |
| `/api/v1/security` | Incidents, incident updates, alerts |
| `/api/v1/reports` | Dashboard and module reports |
| `/api/v1/audit` | Audit log queries |
| `/api/v1/health` | Database-aware readiness check |
| `/api/v1/metrics` | Basic uptime, memory, and Node.js metrics |

## 8. Order Persistence Status

The order page previously inserted demo rows into React state when an API request failed. That meant the row disappeared after refresh.

That issue has been corrected:

- Client and supplier lists are loaded from the database.
- New orders use a real `clientId`.
- New purchase orders use a real `supplierId`.
- Random frontend-only IDs are no longer used for saved records.
- API errors are shown to the user instead of being silently ignored.
- Create, approve, and dispatch operations reload data from PostgreSQL after success.

The page can still display an empty list when the database contains no records. It no longer treats fake demo rows as saved business data.

## 9. Environment Configuration

The backend reads `backend/.env`, which is ignored by Git. Important settings include:

- `DATABASE_URL`: low-privilege runtime database connection
- `DIRECT_URL`: privileged connection used only for Prisma migrations
- `PORT`: backend port, normally `3000`
- `NODE_ENV`: `development`, `test`, or `production`
- `JWT_SECRET`: access-token signing secret
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`: refresh-token signing secret
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: allowed frontend origins
- `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: seed credentials

Never copy real `.env` values into documentation, source control, screenshots, or chat.

## 10. First-Time Local Setup

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- PostgreSQL running on port `5433`
- Database `dvs_factory`

Backend:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate:deploy
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

Frontend, in another terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/`.

The local admin credentials are defined in the ignored `backend/.env`. Do not assume the old example password from historical documentation is still valid.

## 11. Useful Validation Commands

```powershell
cd backend
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run db:migrate:deploy

cd ..\frontend
npm run build
```

A healthy local installation should have:

- Backend build passing
- Backend lint passing
- 77 backend tests passing
- Frontend production build passing
- No pending Prisma migrations
- `GET /api/v1/health` returning `{ "status": "ok", "database": "ok" }`

## 12. Production Operation

The repository includes:

- PM2 configuration in `backend/ecosystem.config.cjs`
- Nginx HTTPS proxy template in `ops/nginx/dvs-industry.conf`
- Windows and Linux PostgreSQL backup scripts
- Deployment notes in `ops/README.md`

Production still needs environment-specific work:

1. A real domain and DNS A records pointing to the server
2. A public server with ports 80 and 443 available
3. Let’s Encrypt/Certbot certificate issuance
4. PM2 startup registration and saved process list
5. Daily backups copied to separate storage
6. External uptime monitoring for `/api/v1/health`
7. Centralized log collection

The local project is not the same thing as a production deployment. DNS, certificates, firewall rules, cloud storage, and server credentials must be configured for the target environment.

## 13. Current Progress

### Working

- Backend API modules and Prisma repositories
- PostgreSQL schema and 9 migrations

- Add automated frontend tests and end-to-end tests for every form
- Replace any remaining presentation-only mock charts or summary data with live report APIs where applicable
- Use a real production domain, TLS, backup destination, monitoring service, and centralized logs
- Review and remediate remaining backend dependency audit advisories without using unreviewed breaking upgrades
- Add backup restore drills and disaster-recovery documentation

## 14. How to Understand a New Feature

When adding or debugging a feature, follow this order:

1. Find the frontend page or form.
2. Find its module service under `frontend/src/lib/services`.
3. Find the matching route under `backend/src/routes`.
4. Check the Zod validator.
5. Check the controller and service business rules.
6. Check the repository method that calls Prisma.
7. Check the related model and migration in `backend/prisma`.
8. Confirm the frontend reloads the saved API response rather than keeping a local-only copy.
9. Add or update a backend test.
10. Run build, lint, tests, and a live API smoke test.
